## About The Project

An app which allows users to randomly generate a list of activities given a random list of criteria, price, participants. The users will be presented with options and will be able to swipe left (delete) or swipe right (add to basket). API sourced from https://.

Once the user has done navigating their list of activities, they can review their activity bucket-list on the "my boredom list". They will be presented with cards displaying their choices. The uSearch tool bar will allow users to make simple web queries from inside the app to search for activities in their local area. API sourced from https://r/.
